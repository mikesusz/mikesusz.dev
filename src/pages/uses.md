This is about the software tools that I use to develop.

## Code Editing

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my primary development environment. I have the configuration synched across all my computers using [settings sync built into VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)

Theme: [HackTheBox](https://github.com/silofy/hackthebox) i love this, obviously as you can tell from the design of my website. I'm using [a fork of it] wherein i've only changed a few things -- notably increasing the contrast between inactive items and the background (line numbers, tab titles) and added colors for the scroll thumb.

Notable Extensions:

- [Astro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) - Language support for Astro
- [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - learn to code by making the squiggles go away
- [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - formatting
- [copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) - a nice robot to help with syntax errors
- [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) - good for viewing simple projects that don't create their own http server
- [colorize](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kamikillerto.vscode-colorize)- is a really cool extension that shows you the colors of css variables inline in your code
- [indent rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) - makes a rainbow out of your indents. this is really useful for deeply nested files (like terrible html email templates)
- [indent rainbow palettes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evondev.indent-rainbow-palettes) - a set of jazzy palettes for indent rainbow
- [peacock](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock) - changes the color of some of the chrome of VSCode. i find this super useful to have different colors for different projects, so when i have multiple windows open i can quickly figure out where each project is located.
