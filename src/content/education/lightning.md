I started focusing on Salesforce technologies because as a developer in IBM Consulting, I need to be aware of the new work that is being signed, and try to adapt my skillset to qualify for more and varied work. Recently there has been a focus on expanding their Salesforce engagements, and I've seen more front-end focused roles opening up that require Salesforce technologies.

So in my current stint 'on the bench' I've chosen to focus on Salesforce, specifically building experiences with Lightning Web Components. LWC is built atop standard web technologies -- the shadow DOM, and Web Component standards.

In the past few weeks i've completed 39 Badges in Trailhead, including:

- Lightning Web Components
	- Basics
	- Quick Start
	- Best Practices
	- Inter-Component Communication
	- Tests
	- Troubleshooting
	- App Builder
	- Coding for Accessibility
- Agentforce
	- Introduction
	- Builder
	- Einstein Trust Layer
	- Prompt Fundamentals
	- Natural Language Processing
	- Data Cloud Connections

And while I haven't been assigned to a Salesforce engagement yet, I hope this helps me leverage everything I've done before and apply it to new and different assignments at work.
