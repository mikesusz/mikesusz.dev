This one seemed at first to be a bit redundant; I've been using GitHub for years, and using git for even longer. But beyond the basics of how I'm used to interacting with repositories, the course gets into more specifics:

 - Pages
 - Workflows
 - Codespaces
 - Copilot
 - Project Management


And while the projects that I'm usually assigned to may not use all of these features, some will.
