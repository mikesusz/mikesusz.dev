This one seemed at first to be a bit redundant; I've been using GitHub for years, and using git for even longer. But beyond the basics of how I'm used to interacting with repositories, the course gets into more specifics:

- Pages
- Workflows
- Codespaces
- Copilot
- Project Management

And while the projects that I'm usually assigned to may not use all of these features, some will.
