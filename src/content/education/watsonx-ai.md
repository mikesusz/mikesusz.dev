This course from IBM was part of a greater curriculum on the foundations of AI. This focused on watsonx.ai and IBM's tools to build ai chat and agents.

While I will try to avoid sounding like a salesperson for IBM, I did learn a lot about the [watsonx.ai studio](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) product we offer and how it can be used to create AI Agents, engineer prompts, generate synthetic data, and connect data for things like RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
