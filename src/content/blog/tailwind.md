In an effort to learn new things outside my 'comfort zone' I had heard good things about building projects using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This site <strike>is</strike> was previously built with it!

Tailwild is built on the principle of using shorthand CSS classes to produce powerful rules and maintain consistency across elements. After an initial slight learning curve, as I worked with it I found myself being able to intuitively guess what shorthand codes I should use for the effects that I wanted.

This would probably be a great solution for projects like client websites, where another developer might take over and maintain the site in the future, and not have to mentally de-compile a mountain of custom CSS attributes assigned to semantically named class elements.

For this iteration of the site, I'd paired it for development with a lightweight local hot-reloading web server called [Live Server](http://tapiov.net/live-server/).
