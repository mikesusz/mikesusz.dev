description: One of the ways I got my hands moving in React again was to repeat the Carbon Design System - React tutorial, this time around with my personal account.

While I've been using [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) at work, I didn't have anything I could demonstrate on my personal account. Everything I've built for [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) lives in Enterprise Github, and heck - I can't even log into the user-facing side of the application anymore (being the Scrum Master as well as the Security & Compliance focal, I created sprint tasks to delete all of my accounts after I was no longer on the team!)

So to have some record of my experience using it, I completed the [Carbon Design System Tutorial](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/overview/) and earned the credential: _IBM Carbon Design System Developer Essentials - React_ on [my profile at Credly](https://www.credly.com/users/michael-susz/badges). I think I'm going to start building a new fun side project with Carbon as well - I will post about it here when I'm ready to share.

While I'm somewhat partial to Carbon since I've used it so recently, I think _using_ a Design System is probably more important than _which particular one you use._ A long time ago at Washington Mutual (RIP), I was part of a small team that created a Pattern Library for reusable compoments -- we agreed this was the best method for us to have consistent experiences for our users, while publishing the best, most compatible and most accessible code.
