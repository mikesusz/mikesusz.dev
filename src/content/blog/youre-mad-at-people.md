"AI is making art and music while I do chores! I wanted computers to do chores so I can make art and music!"

It's funny when posted to Facebook. You nod agreeably. If you're a web developer, you've probably felt this, too.

AI doesn't act on its own, it responds to prompts by human beings.

### This is not new

My career (here he goes again!) has spanned three decades and has faced existential crises before. New software arrives and we all bemoan "well, if anyone can do the specialized thing that I've spent years perfecting, this is the end of my livelihood!"

#### Example: Photoshop

If you've used Photoshop (or a similar graphics editor) have you ever used the 'lasso' tool to precisely select a shape? Tracing the little marching-ants around the object you wanted to retain or enhance? I was great at that. I spent years perfecting that skill. Then the Magic Wand tool gave way to the Quick Selection tool. (for what they do, the names seem to be reversed, don't they?)

Years before automated 'drop shadows' in graphics, we used to: duplicate a Layer, adjust Curves so all the visible area is black, add Gausian Blur, reduce Layer Opacity, and shift it _N_ pixels to the left and down.

&hellip;

I could go on. You probably want me to digress.

#### Example: WYSIWYG

Perhaps more relevant to the coding community (although it may feel like a preposterous history lesson): the introduction of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors.

Back in the _late nineteen-hundreds_ those of us who knew HTML were like wizards. Some of us even had professional titles that ended in '-master.' If you could embrace and understand that HTML as a markup language was a peculiar set of nested boxes that interacted with each other, you could get rich! (or so I'm told. I worked at a college throughout the first 'dot-com bubble' so my only "options" were ... paper or plastic?)

In 1996, I was waiting in line for Macworld Expo at the Bayside Convention Center in Boston. (sorry you'll have to search for this stuff on your own if you want, if I footnote everything I'll never get this published). Some nice folks walked the line, chatting with attendees. When they reached me and learned I was a Webmaster, they handed me a disc containing GoLive Cyberstudio 1.0.

GoLive would evolve, and later be acquired by Adobe. Competitors rose up as well, all providing a similar front-end development experience - laying out web pages graphically without needing to touch any code. They promised to remove all friction from creating a great new web experience without needing to be a developer.

They took my wizard robe and made it available to anyone with a CD-ROM drive! Well, sort of. These new tools let you do amazing things, within a whole constellation of constraints. Some WYSIWYG editors gave you clean layout with simple HTML structures. Some gave you tables! Most of these WYSIWYG tools produced HTML that was inscrutable.

Ultimately some of us chose these as a first-draft kind of tool, then tweaked the output by hand to achieve desired results. Eventually, they fizzled out because the benefits never outweighed the drawbacks.

You get an incredible advancement from concept to finished product &mdash; but with major caveats.

#### Mastery is only possible with expertise

No matter what tools you use, _mastery_ is only possible via expertise gained through education and experience. The ability to envision, anticipate, steer, produce, react, and refine is not something an amateur with a magic button can do.

Will the machines get better at refining? Somewhat, as long as the user is able to craft a prompt in a precise fashion that makes the tool respond appropriately. The difficulty here is that the tools themselves are completely opaque, and even positive results can feel like luck. Try again and hope your do-over is better. Repeat your lucky do-overs until the most satisfacation is achieved.

You can't (ever) understand how the tool _really_ works so all you can do is measure the output and tweak the input. It's like &hellip; Search-Engine Optimization for art or code. And anyone who is hitting tab completion may/will hit a point where they hit tab, and functional code does not auto-complete. what then?

#### Reliability is only possible with experience

There's another aspect of code creation that only those with experience are going to weigh in on. Have you ever been responsible for code in production?

It's great that more people can create what are essentially high-resolution prototypes quickly. But if you take that code and push it to production, how are you assuring availability, scalability, performance, security, and accessibility?

Do you want to carry the pager home with you for the vide-code that just got deployed? And when the pager goes off, does the vibe coder know how to do root-cause analysis and fix the problem?

To depend on the solutions we deploy, we still need people with experience. And for accessible, secure, and performant solutions, we still need smart people who care.

### It's all going to be OK

If the same tools are available to everyone, it buoys the value of everyone. The difference will be whether we chose:

A. to empower all workers to be able to do more work more easily, or

B. to reduce the number of workers and expect the same output from fewer people who are armed with more tools

Some companies will, no doubt, take the immediate gratification of B. It will make their quarterly revenue reports better, up until they are outpaced by their competition.

In market disruptions caused by productivity boosts, we have consistently seen long-term innovation beat out short-term gains. Not many companies exist with the goal to stay at exactly the same revenue, but grow profitability by reducing overhead. Growth comes from innovation, innovation comes from ideas, and ideas come from people.

When the spreadsheet replaced the ledger, and when the website replaced the mail-order catalog, people adapted and adopted new roles that no longer required hand-recording transactions or opening envelopes.

### You're mad at people

You're not mad at AI for creating art or music or writing or code. You're mad at those people who are using it. Those people are novices who are producing work that you find commensurate with what you think you can make with your hard-fought skills and abilities.

Those people cannot competently and predictably repeat their success. They cannot confidently produce work that is performant, reliable, accessible, and bug-free.

Those people are a lot like you, they're just in a different part of their journey. Those people are using a new tool, and maybe you are not.
