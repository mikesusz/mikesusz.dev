<!-- thesis: if you're mad at AI are actually mad at people. -->

"AI is making art and music while I do chores! I wanted computers to do chores so I can make art and music!"

It's funny when posted to Facebook. You nod agreeably.

<!-- people are using a tool -->

AI does nothing by itself. AI responds to prompts by human beings.

<!-- the tool makes things much easier -->

### This is not new

My career (here he goes again!) has spanned three decades and faced existential crises before. New software arrives and we all bemoan "well if anyone can do the specialized thing that I've spent years perfecting, this is the end of my livelihood!"

<!-- examples: photoshop -->

#### Photoshop

If you've used Photoshop (or a similar graphics editor) have you ever used the 'lasso' tool to precisely select a shape? Tracing the little marching-ants around the object you wanted to retain or enhance? I was great at that. I spent years perfecting that skill. Then the Magic Wand tool gave way to the Quick Selection tool. (for what they do, the names seem to be reversed, no?)

Years before automated 'drop shadows' we used to: duplicate a layer, adjust Curves so all the visible area was black, add gausian blur, reduce layer opacity, and shift it _N_ pixels to the left and down.

&hellip;

I could go on. You probably want me to digress.


<!-- examples: wysiwyg editors -->

#### WYSIWYG

Perhaps more relevant to the coding community (although it may feel like a preposterous history lesson): the introduction of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors.

Back in the _late nineteen-hundreds_ those of us who knew HTML were like wizards. Some of us even had professional titles that ended in '-master.' If you could embrace and understand that HTML as a markup language was a peculiar set of nested boxes that interacted with each other, you could make bank. (or so I'm told. I worked at a college throughout the first 'dot-com bubble' so my only options were ... paper or plastic?)

In 1996, I was waiting in line for Macworld Expo at the Bayside Convention Center in Boston. (sorry you'll have to search for this stuff on your own, if I footnote everything I'll never get this published). Some nice folks were walking down the line, chatting with the waiting attendees. When they got to me, they asked what I did. I told them I was a Webmaster, of course. So they handed me a disc containing GoLive Cyberstudio 1.0.

They took my wizard robe and made it available to anyone with a CD-ROM drive! Well, sort of. These new tools let you do amazing things, within a collection of constraints. Some of us adopted them as a first-crack kind of tool, then we exported HTML to update by hand. Some of these WYSIWYG tools produced HTML that was inscrutable.

You get an incredible advancement from concept to finished product &mdash; with caveats.

#### Templates!

The 2000s and blogging engines gave rise to the fully-formed Template.


<!-- refinement is still only possible with expertise -->

#### Mastery is only possible with expertise

No matter what tools you use, _mastery_ is only possible via expertise gained through education or experience (ideally, both). The ability to envision, anticipate, steer, produce, react, and refine is not something an amateur with a machine can do.

Will the machines get better at refining? Yes, as long as the user is able to craft a prompt in a precise fashion that makes the tool respond appropriately. The difficulty here is that the tools themselves are completely opaque, and even positive results can feel like luck. Try again and hope your do-over is better. Repeat your lucky do-overs until satisfacation is achieved.

The current state feels like gambling - AI is an arcade claw machine where the windows are painted black, so you can't see what it may grab, but it can guarantee it drops something into the chute every time.

<!-- this is all prattle and needs to be edited -->

Mastery is a combination of intention and execution. Mastery is the ability to predict and proscribe the outcome of your efforts.

<!-- if the same tools are available to everyone, it lifts the value of everyone -->




<!-- i have more than one hammer -->

<!-- refusing to evaluate and consider adopting the tools is going to make you less valuable -->


<!-- also - you're not making music or art because it's hard and it feels bad to suck at something for a long time before you're good at it. Just like it's hard to drive in a nail with your bare hands. -->
