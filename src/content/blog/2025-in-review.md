Everyone is probably tired of 'wrapped' style posts (myself included) but something I've always struggled with is self-reflection and celebrating my accomplishments. Let's see what I can remember doing for the past year.

## Work

Work has been really challenging this year. Consulting has seen major disruption, especially for an organization that does so much contract work for the US Government. Signing and spending for new projects was greatly impacted by government restructuring, and then the wave of AI hit. It's not that AI is being used to generate work that would normally be done by all-human teams (but that's part of it), for Consulting the bigger impact this year I think is the uncertaintly of whether or not to commit to contracts or wait until the AI tools are available and/or updated to be able to produce better output.

This is especially impactful for people who do front-end development, as a lot of the more rote development we do for common interfaces can be done by someone with less front-end experience. Ultimately I think the market will settle out where more experienced people maintain their value -- if the tools are available to everyone, it should buoy all of us.

### Work Projects

Some of the outcomes I contributed to:

- connecting victims of the California wildfires to available resources
- updating the way that organizations create and process needs requests for victims of domestic violence (who may not have an address of record, and who want to remain anonymous as they get help).
- creating a proof of concept that was used to bid on a contract. It involved using Carbon Design System and watsonx.ai assistant to create a document retrieval/troubleshooting chatbot. This was my first time making a chat interface, and the first time I've consumed and displayed output from watsonx.

### Work Training

While not on assignment, I'm expected to fill my time by (relentlessly looking for a new assignment, and) learning new things to shape my skillset to better match the work that we have incoming. For IBM's Consulting clients, this meant I spent considerable time learning about our partnerships and integrations. This was primarily learning about hosting and architecture in Azure, and web component development in Salesforce.

I also had some freedom to explore new things that I want to learn (as long as I can see a path to them being valuable in the future) so I added to my curriculum a lot of courses on AI and LLMs. To pre-requisite many of these courses, I learned Python (which frankly felt really similar to various languages I've worked with in the past three decades).

Another area of my skillset that I felt needed rounding-out was on design/UX tooling apps. I took a lot of courses on Figma, and now I feel like I understand project organization and auto-layout.

Ultimately, I logged more than 200 hours of formal training, and received six 'digital credentials' for completing official courses.

## Personal

This year had a lot of unexpected personal health challenges that impacted everything I do related to work and home. But the time I got to spend working on personal projects was still pretty impactful.

### Personal Projects

Things I did this year:


- converted my website hosting to Coolify and I currently have 16 websites serving off of that platform

- migrated my [personal blog](https://mikesusz.com) from a shared-hosting platform to Coolify, which required setting up additional docker containers for mysql (someday I might migrate it off of wordpress!)

- created a [website to track my reading log](https://reading.mikesusz.com)

- created a website for my son's gamer persona, which currently just retrieves and displays his latest youtube videos, but this taught me about google/youtube's APIs for doing things like that.

- launched a neat little tool to [generate QR codes](https://qr.sqd.co)

- created a site for my kids and my projects in wplace.live

- made a neat [visualization](https://blink.sqd.co) for the band members of blink-182 (super early beta on this one)

- made a [tool](https://time.sqd.co) that shows you the number of days from today to an arbitrary date in the past, and then the same amount of days further beyond that (it's like an automated way to feel old, fast)

- moved my work/business email off of google workplace and onto fastmail, adding a bunch of domains that I've owned for years but hadn't used yet

- set up a server on my basement with docker to host
	- pi-hole for local DNS and ad-blocking
	- home assistant to manage IoT-driven lights and make them available to our iOS devices, and create scheduling automations
	- airplay to speakers connected to the server in the basement (and garage)

- updated my [old site](https://squaredesign.com) with a message about selling it, and did more work to divest myself of that domain

- decided to try and set up a new [storefront](https://shop.sqd.co) for my years-ago sticker business, and soft-launch it in this post :)
