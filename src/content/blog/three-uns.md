Having kids has changed me. I try not to project my issues onto them. But, in observing their behavior, I sometimes see in them things that I (for decades and decades) failed to see in myself and therefore still struggle with today.

One of my kids has a difficult time _getting started_ doing things. Does this sound familiar? They’re not unhelpful, they’re not lazy, but they sometimes just can’t seem to get going on something, either important or trivial. But once they _get going_ they knock it out of the park, usually.

Like Peter Gibbons said in Office Space, "it’s a question of motivation." Or is it? Sometimes I’ve found that my kid knows they should be doing something, but there’s something else that’s preventing them from making progress. So as I’ve thought about this, I’ve distilled the lesson down to 3 points, and also hope I can take my own advice in my own projects and work.

There are three reasons people don’t do things. The Three Uns:

_Unaware_, _Unable_, and _Unwilling_

## Unaware ##

If you’re *Unaware* of what you’re supposed to do, you’ll never do it, obviously. This is like a ticketing system that piles up tasks for you but you never get an email notification. Or, you’re part of a team with shared responsibilities, but nobody effectively delegated tasks and there are things that everyone else is expecting you to take care of, but you’re oblivious. Unaware is usually a systematic problem that needs to be solved at a higher level or in a more holistic way.

Not that it's out of your hands, but the solution will likely involve more than you. (and this part doesn't cover your ennjoyment of being 'blissfully ignorant' of what's required of you. keeping yourself in the dark goes down below, in _Unwilling_)

## Unable ##

So okay, good, you’re aware of what’s being asked of you. But, you’re *Unable* to do it. This might be that you lack access to accounts or systems to complete a task, you are time-constrained and have higher priority work to finish, or maybe you’re being asked to do something that’s too far outside your ken and don’t have the skill necessary to be successful.

Unable is something that needs to be solved by a combination of of external and internal restructuring — you need fewer tasks, you need your management to weigh in on priorities, you need more training or to swap tasks with someone so that you’re being more effective with work that you’re qualified for.

## Unwilling ##

The last of the three is different. This is the one I deal with the most when trying to help my kids (and frankly, probably also myself) and that is Unwilling. You know what you’re being asked to do, you know how to do it and have access to all the resources and knowledge that you need to be successful, you just aren’t motivated to complete it.

Unwilling is far more difficult. This is where Peter's perspective comes in -- if he works harder and Initech shifts a few extra units, he doesn't see another dime. Where's the motivation?

It's a glib response (and a great movie, if you haven't seen it, really, find it and watch it) but it gets to the root causes of Unwilling. The problem with Unwilling is how we perceive (or if we're able to perceive) the rewards for success, or conversely how we foresee the possible consequences of failure, and how we weigh the two of those things.

Here's an example: put your laundry away. (do you have a basket full of clean laundry in your house anywhere? or 2 of them? or ... more?) The reward for putting your laundry away is a collection of small benefits: Ease of outfit selection. Some modicum of time savings when dressing. More floorspace that was previously occupied by the clean laundry basket.

But what are the consequences of not doing it? Well, losing a bit of floorspace that you don't care about anyway, losing a bit of time in the morning that you would have wasted otherwise. So how do we motivate ourselves to do it?

That's easy -- we take away your video game time. Wait, no. Obviously the consequence of being Unwilling to complete this particular task, is, low risk at worst. Airplanes don't crash if you don't put your laundry away.

## How to get better ##

We've finally found the payoff of the article. How do we get better at managing and mitigating The Three Uns?

I'll give you my answer, and it doesn't always work, but it takes the above perceptions into account and makes your task success friction _tangible_.

The first thing to solve is Unaware. and you actually can have a hand in solving this systematic problem. The solution is obviously different for professional and personal matters, so let's separate them.

### Work Problems ###

If you're applying for a new job, literally ask them about the workflow - where do tasks come from, how are requests handled, what does an average day look like? If they can't answer exactly that could be a warning sign, or an opportunity. As a newcomer you can point out the inefficiencies of the system and participate in the work to streamline them. Surely there are incumbents who are suffering under the current system who you can motivate to help you, or at least will idolyze you if you manage to affect positive change.

if you manage to make this better, you will be revered. If you try and try but are pushed back at every turn, you can find new employ with a clear conscience. Far too often I've taken a seat on the bench next to my comrades, grabbed an oar, and rowed with them, sharing their drudgery. I don't want to do that anymore.

### You Problems ###

For your personal affairs, I've found that the easiest way to get a handle on Unaware is getting all your responsibilities into _some system_ that isn't your frazzled memory. This part is up to you: Todo apps, a whiteboard in the kitchen, put a Post-It note on the dog.

The point of getting everything into one system is that your brain is no longer taxed with remembering them, you can instead focus on weighing their value, prioritizing them against each other, and -- actually executing on (some of) them!
