As I roll off of an intense assignment at work, I've got a bit of free brain space to reflect on the kind of work we've been doing, how we have done it, and how this affects -- _The Future._

## We have to go back...

In college, I spent a lot of time in computer labs. Since I was studying Architecture, it was split between PCs running DOS with AutoCAD, and VT terminals where I used Pine to send emails to my brother and my friends at different schools (I can send as many messages as I want? to anyone? for free??)

When my account on the VAX was created I noticed a `'public_html'` directory was made by default. I asked the lab monitor what that was - and they explained I could put documents in there that would be visible via the web. (I can make as many web pages as I want? they can be seen by anyone? for free??)

My first 'homepage' was written with the vi editor on a VT100 terminal. I usually viewed it (any any other web site I wanted to read) using Gopher or Lynx.

I was hooked. I didn't know it at the time, but I would ultimately end up dropping out of the Architecture program, and be hired as the first full-time employee Webmaster of my college. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

So here I was, a late teen-turning-twenty-something, with opinions and interests. (they were probably not very good opinions, but that did not deter me.) I created pages for all of my interests - TV Shows, Movies, Music. I wrote about my love of these things, I linked to other people's web pages (for free??) who shared the same interests.

Eventually, I started to notice `[INLINE]` markup in people's homepages. I asked my friendly lab monitor about that. I must have finally depleted their patience, as they sighed quietly and suggested I 'go upstairs and check out the Mac lab.'

### When I first saw Mosaic, everything changed

Mosaic changed everything for me when I realized that it was possible to embed images, and to add _style_ to your web pages (beyond the **bold** and _italic_ that I had managed to render in Gopher). I was an Architecture student, and my interests in design dovetailed into industrial and graphic design also. Having more control over the presentation of my content appealed to me greatly.

### You can make (almost) anything you want

So while learning new and different ways to affect the display of my web pages, there was always a retropective step -- "how will this look in Lynx?" We refused to sacrifice basic access to our content in the pursuit of something new and shiny. We always checked in other/older browsers.

We hand-wrote HTML. The code that we typed was the exact markup being parsed by the browser. If you saved an HTML document from the web, and opened it up in your text editor right next to your source-code, they would be identical.

This is basic to some of us, but perhaps revelatory to others. And maybe even preposterous to others, still. But this was important, for several reasons.

We cared about the final markup because we were building something to be consumed now _and in perpetutity_. Web 'browsers' were new, and new ones were being invented all the time. These were not only copycats of functionality with a different wrapper, they were _different types of interaction_ with the content we were producing. Gopher and Lynx were text-only. Mosaic (and Netscape Navigator and Opera and Internet Explorer and even Cyberdog) were graphical. What was next? 3D?

We never assumed what was next. It was easy to see a future where our content would be consumed via (something) that hadn't been invented yet. And for the most part, we were correct. Eventually we got Web Spiders and early Search Engines. We got early mobile phones with WAP browsers that would display ... a version of our content.

How could technology that was not invented yet understand what we were creating today?

### Standards

So much of what I learned early on was by viewing the source of other websites, changing markup, reloading. We didn't even have the huge O'reilly HTML book yet. But the mid-1990s gave us the W3C, and (most of) the browser makers were creating engines to render standard HTML, so we began writing standard HTML.

## Back ... to The Future!

## The Future

My first concern about the future is -- am I the only one who is concerned about _The Future?_ This might sound like a small thing, but it's a big thing.

A lot of the technology we've added to the UI development stack is purportedly to make the _developer experience_ better - to help us to write "better" software, faster. I use the term _software_ here because in terms of complexity, that seems to be what we're making.

The practitioners of today have learned about web development in Computer Science curriculums, where they also learned about (compilers, object-oriented languages, databases, etc.). They are conditioned to write _software_.

## And I'll be frank with you - the output is _garbage._

Mere 'div soup' would be a blessing. What I've been seeing disgorged into the browser DOM is nothing short of a slow-motion disaster zone. "It renders correctly! (in Chrome)" is of course the immediate response that I will receive to this complaint. But I will elaborate further, by going back.
