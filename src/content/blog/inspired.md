I haven't felt like this in a long time.

Recently I've spent some time enhancing my local development environment(s), taking advantage of new plugins and resources to increase the speed and accuracy (and dare I say, enjoyment) of my work.

While I am sometimes critical of people who constantly spend time tweaking their development environment (doing meta-work but not real work) I realized that my aversion to doing this meant that I dealt with day-to-day task friction that could be eliminated with a bit of maintenance.

Firstly, for development I use [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the theme I prefer is called [HackTheBox](https://github.com/silofy/hackthebox). I've since continued to unify my development environment by integrating [HackTheBox colors into vim and Windows Terminal](https://github.com/audibleblink/hackthebox.vim). (If you're on Windows and you haven't used [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701), I strongly recommend it. It's modern, customizable, and capable of running multiple shells including bash, via the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or simply using the bash integrated with git-bash)

Then, I got my VSCode settings syncing from my work/client Windows environment to my work Mac environment and my personal Windows and Mac environments (via [settings sync built into VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync), you can choose to do so via Github or Microsoft accounts).

Why stop there when we can further unify the appearance of our environments? So I customized my windows environment to use colors from the HackTheBox profile also. I prefer dark environments while working due to eye strain, so I'm really enjoying this aesthetic.

Once my dev environments were up to speed, I turned my attention to my oft-neglected website (you know what's said about the cobbler's children). My current website platform, [Astro](https://astro.build/), has had a major version upgrade and the between-release changes are getting less impactful. I was able recently to upgrade from 2.0.1 to 2.4.4 and not have anything break - this is excellent. But besides working code, I currently had no design.

I took inspiration from the colors I see every day - HackTheBox highlight colors specifically, you'll see the left side bars are comprised of #9F00FF, #004CFF, #FFAF00, #FF3E3E, #9FEF00 (in linear gradient code that I wrote by hand). The colored bar on the side is a nod to one of my favorite records, New Order's [Blue Monday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_%28New_Order_song%29) 12" single vinyl sleeve (designed to look like a 5-&frac14;" floppy disk)

And now, as I've said before, _Onward!_
