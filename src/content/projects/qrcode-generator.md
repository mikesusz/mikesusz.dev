This project was born out of frustration with 'free' tools to do the same, coupled with ads and creepy tracking stuff. Generating QR codes is a simple problem that smart people solved with JavaScript years ago.

So this is a simple QR code generator that allows users to create QR codes from text input. You can choose the size of the image generated, and right click/download the file in png format.
