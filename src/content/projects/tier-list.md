I made a self-hosted, privacy-focused Tier List.

If you don't know what a Tier List is, I apologize and I'll quote [the wikipedia tier list entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_list): "A tier list is a ranking system where items are subjectively arranged in tiers from the best to worst. The concept originated in video game culture where playable characters or other in-game elements are ranked by their viability. In addition to video game elements, tier lists have been used to rank items from other subjects, such as films, sports teams, logos, animals, and tabletop games. The purpose of a tier list is usually to give room for discussion in the subject, to create an easily understandable overview, or simply to entertain."

my kids complained that free “tier list” websites are full of invasive ads that make them really annoying to use. this one is free & can run from an html file on your computer, or clone the repo and host it on github pages, or push it to your own domain (or use it on mine!).

The main features:

- Drag & Drop - Easily move items between tiers
- Image Upload - Add your own images via drag-drop or file picker
- Customizable Tiers - Add, remove, rename, and recolor tiers
- Auto-Save - Your progress is saved automatically to your browser
- Export Options
  - Save as PNG image for sharing
  - Export/import JSON data for backup (which includes images!)

Enjoy! If you have any problems with the code, you can open an Issue on your Github repo. I did not make this responsive on purpose, as I envisioned this being used by streamers and youtubers on a desktop computer with normal window sizes. I'm not sure how much utility would be gained by making it adaptive.
